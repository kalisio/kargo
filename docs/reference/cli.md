* an existing **rclone** remote source if the archive is stored on a well-known store (i.e. Google Driver, OpenStack Object Store, AWS S3...).

The following parameters allow to import the archive `dummy-1.2.1` from a remote `bucket` using **rclone**. The source `store` must be defined in your **rclone** configuration file.

```bash
DUMMY_ARCHIVE=store:bucket/dummy-1.2.1.tgz
