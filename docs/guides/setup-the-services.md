# Setup the services

## Configure the services

1. Make a copy of our `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`

2. Update the file with your preferences:

```
TODO
```

## Build the services

Some of the services provided By **Kargo** need to be built and pushed to the local registry in order to be able to deploy them. 
You simply need to run the command:

```bash
$./build-kargo.sh
```
